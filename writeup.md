# BalanceWidget

## About

BalanceWidget is a widget that makes it easy for users to manage their money. Why did I choose to create this widget in the planner app? Because I hope this widget can help to keep track of income and expenses. No more forgetting where the money came from and where the money was spent.

> Note: You can check the source code of this widget in the file `src/widgets/BalanceWidget.js`

## How to use it?

- Users simply add the "Manage Your Money" widget to the main page.
- Fill in the existing forms such as title (ex. salary, buy a coffee, etc), amount and status (income or expenses).
